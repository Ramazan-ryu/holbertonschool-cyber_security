Question #0
What is a vulnerability?

A feature that enhances security
+++A flaw in a system or network that can be exploited
An encrypted communication channel
A configuration setting for network devices

Question #1
Which of the following is an example of an injection attack?

++++SQL Injection
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Buffer Overflow
Insecure Deserialization

Question #2
How can Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) be mitigated?

Use anti-CSRF tokens
+++Encode outputs and use a Content Security Policy (CSP)
Use stack canaries
Disable encryption

Question #3
Which tool is used for dynamic vulnerability analysis?

SonarQube
+++++Burp Suite
Nessus
Checkmarx

Question #4
Which of the following is an example of a security misconfiguration?

+++++Default credentials left unchanged
SQL Injection
Stack overflow error
Use of parameterized queries

Question #5
Which of the following best defines a threat?

A weakness that can be exploited
++++The potential to cause harm to an asset
A protective measure against vulnerabilities
The process of assessing risks

Question #6
What is the formula for calculating risk according to the text?

Risk = (Cost of the asset) / (Probability of the threat)
Risk = (Probability that a threat occurs) + (Cost to the asset owner)
++++Risk = (Probability that a threat occurs) * (Cost to the asset owner)
Risk = (Vulnerabilities) - (Threats)

Question #7
What is a key factor that determines if a vulnerability is exploitable?

The presence of a patch
+++++The availability of a working exploit
The age of the vulnerability
The size of the software

Question #8
A vulnerability becomes exploitable when:

++++It is discovered by a security researcher
An attacker creates an exploit that successfully targets the vulnerability
The software is no longer supported
The vulnerability is documented in a security report

Question #9
Which stage in the vulnerability lifecycle indicates that a vulnerability has been successfully exploited?

Discovery
Development
++++Exploitation
Mitigation

Question #10
What is a common cause of vulnerabilities related to programming mistakes?

Insecure Defaults
++++Buffer Overflows
Misconfigurations
Lack of Authentication

Question #11
What can lead to security misconfigurations in software?

Strong Passwords
+++Default Settings
Regular Updates
Code Reviews
