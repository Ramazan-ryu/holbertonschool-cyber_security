What defines the rules for data exchange in networks?

NSF
+++TCP/IP+++
SMTP
SMB
LDAP

Question #1
Which protocol is used for sending emails?

HTTP
FTP
SNMP
+++SMTP+++
SMB

Question #2
What can SNMP provide regarding network devices?

User authentication
+++Network device performance data++++
Email transfer methods
File sharing capabilities
DNS resolution data

Question #3
How does SMB support file sharing?

By encrypting email content
++++By enabling inter-OS file sharing++++
Through user credentials management
By converting IP addresses to domain names
By providing performance data

Question #4
What’s LDAP used for in networks?

Email transmission
File sharing
+++++Authentication and authorization++++
Data packet filtering
Performance monitoring

Question #5
What security concerns arise with RDP usage?

Traffic filtering inefficiency
++++Encryption breaches+++++
Email spoofing risks
Incompatibility between OSs
Device performance issues

Question #6
What distinguishes TCP/IP from OSI model?

++++Layers in OSI model++++++
Email transmission in TCP/IP
File sharing capability in OSI
User authentication in TCP/IP
Performance monitoring in OSI

Question #7
How do firewalls utilize network protocols?

+++++To filter unwanted traffic++++
For email routing purposes
To manage user credentials
To transfer files over the network
For DNS resolution

Question #8
What difference do secure protocols have?

++++HTTPS and SFTP use encryption+++
HTTP and FTP are encrypted by default
HTTPS involves file sharing processes
SFTP used for email transmission only
Insecure protocols use a different layer

Question #9
Why is SSH considered beneficial?

It supports email encryption only
++++Allows secure remote file access++++
It is used for DNS resolution
Ensures data packet filtering
Involves multilayer traffic filtering

Question #10
Identify the network stack layers’ functions.

SMTP handles physical connections
+++TCP/IP enables application-specific duties+++
SNMP determines hardware connections
SMB concerns with seamless data routing exclusively
LDAP manages data transport integrity and reliability

Question #11
What is DNS’s purpose?

Encrypts network communications
+++Resolves domain names to IP addresses++++
Transfers files over the network
Provides email authentication methods
Manages network device performances

Question #12
Why are port numbers relevant?

They route emails to the correct server
Required for DNS resolution only
+++++Signify specific service or application endpoints on a host+++++
Indicate network device performance levels
Used exclusively for physical network connections

Question #13
How do network encryption protocols vary?

++++Some protocols encrypt application layer data only++++
All network protocols equally secure data transmission
+++++Encryption is not used in file sharing protocols like SMB++++
Only LDAP uses encryption for security purposes
SNMP encryption is mandatory across all networks

Question #14
Importance of updated network protocols?

Prevents email spoofing exclusively
++++Patches can fix security vulnerabilities+++++++++
Enhances file-sharing speeds only
Solely improves interoperability between network devices
Ensures DNS resolution accuracy at all times

Question #15
Common network security vulnerabilities?

Encrypted email content can be breached, leading to data loss and privacy issues
SNMP may expose sensitive data if misconfigured or outdated
Shared resources via SMB without proper access control can be exploited
Unsecured RDP connections are susceptible to brute-force attacks
Outdated LDAP implementations may allow unauthorized access
Improperly maintained firewalls might fail to filter malicious traffic
